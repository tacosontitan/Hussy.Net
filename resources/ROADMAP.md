# 🛣️ What does the future hold

The future of Hussy.Net is to simply continue compacting features of the .NET ecosystem in order to give .NET developers
a chance to compete in golfing competitions.

## ✨ Primitives

Primitive support was previously being established with custom data types in an effort to improve handling for implicit
conversions between primitives, handle truthy/falsey values with fewer characters, and a few other features. With the
announcement of extension everything, native primitive support is being abandoned in favor of a consistent delivery
mechanism for all features.
