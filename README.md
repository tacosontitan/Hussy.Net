# 💃 Hussy.Net

Hussy.Net is an esoteric programming language designed for and by C# developers with code golf in mind. It is a minified adaptation of the C# programming language leveraging modern features for clean and concise code.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Hussy.Net is not designed to compete with other golfing languages, but rather to allow C# developers to participate in golfing challenges with a leg to stand on.

## 🚀 Getting Started

The `Hussy.Net.Terminal` project is the place to run your snippets written with Hussy.Net. To get started, fork the repository and clone it to your local machine. Then open the `Hussy.Net` solution and locate the `Program.cs` file under `Hussy.Net.Terminal`. It looks like this:

```csharp
W("Hello, world!");
```

## ✨ Features

Hussy.Net is built with .NET developers in mind. It expands on the C# language directly, so all native C# featues are available by default. In addition to the native features of C#, there are several features which can help you create concise snippets with ease:

- Primitives
- Output Methods
- Complete Modules
